Jan. 15, 2019

Its been a couple years since I have posted to this site, but wanted to add some New Years resolutions and predictions for 2019.  I believe it is good to have goals.  We cannot always predict the future, but what I do know is Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are going to give Amazon Web Services a run for their money and it is a good time to continue learning the Azure (and Google) platform.  Many companies will need to transition their Windows Server 2012 environments to the cloud.   

I will start with 2018.  I was fortunate to attend Azure training from Global Knowledge in October sponsored by my company.  Around Thanksgiving time I completed my Azure Architect certification.  I took the Azure Developer certification in December, but unfortunately did not pass.  This will be the first one I hope to knock out in 2019.  

Early 2019 will be for reattempting the Azure Developer exam (Az-203) and also completing the Azure Architect transition exam (AZ302).  I also want to keep working in Linux and am working on the RHCSA course in Linux Academy.  It is also a good refresher for maintaining this site and using VIM more!  Finally, I want to revisit the CISSP and knock it out.  I have taken this exam twice before, but shelling out $699 is not something I want to do lightly until I feel completely prepared.

2019 Goals:

Azure Developer (AZ203).......................................February 2019
Azure Architect Transition (AZ302)............................March 2019
Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)................June 2019
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)...November 2019
