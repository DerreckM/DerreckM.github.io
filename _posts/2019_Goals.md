Jan. 15, 2019

Its been a couple years since I haveve posted to this site, but wanted to add some New Years resolutions and predictions for 2019.  I believe it is good to have goals.  We cannot always predict the future, but what I do know is Azure and Google Cloud are going to give AWS a run for their money and it is a good time to continue learning the Azure platform.  Many companies will need to transition their Windows Server 2012 environments to the cloud.   

I will start with 2018.  I was fortunate to attend Azure training from Global Knowledge in October sponsored by my company.  Around Thanksgiving time I completed my Azure Architect certification.  I took the Azure Developer certification in December, but unfortunately did not pass.  

Early 2019 will be for reattempting the Azure Developer exam (AZ203) and alsocompleting the Azure Architect transition exam (AZ302).  I also want to keep working in Linux and am working on the RHCSA course in Linux Academy.  It is also a good refresher for maintaining this site and using VIM more!  Finally, I want to revisit the CISSP and knock it out.  I have taken this exam twice before, but shelling out $699 is not something I want to do lightly until I feel completely prepared.

2019 Goals:

Azure Developer (AZ203).......................................February 2019
Azure Architect Transition (AZ302)............................March 2019
Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)................June 2019
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)...November 2019
