A few days ago I received a formal offer to work for Forsythe Technology in Skokie.  It seems like a great opportunity to
work in a large scale IT company and learn about many aspects of their business.  What I really like about their program is
that there is 3 2-month rotations where you get to experience different aspects of their IT business and get a feel for what
areas you have passion for and work with your strengths.

One reason I feel that I was struggling in my interviews, is that I was initially applying to just developer and testing roles.
I'm glad I expanded my job search to other great companies that also provide exposure to code and databases, but also other areas
of IT.  Not only are developer positions competitive, some requiring several years of experience, and others are filled internally.
I'm not even sure what my future in IT will be.  IT analyst, Security Engineer, Project Manager, Solutions Architect, Tester, Developer...???
Best to get my foot in the door at a good company and find your passion while getting valuable experience and a paycheck.  I feel
that I made a good choice accepting Forsythe in my immediate future plans.
