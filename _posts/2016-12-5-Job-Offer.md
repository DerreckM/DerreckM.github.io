A few days ago I received a formal offer to work for Forsythe Technology in Skokie.  It seems like a great opportunity to
work in a large scale IT company and learn about many aspects of their business.  What I really like about their program is
that there is 3 2-month rotations where you get to experience different aspects of their IT business and get a feel for what
areas you have passion for and work with your strengths.  I'll have plenty of time to figure out the exact role I am most
passoniate about.  I'm just glad a good company with happy employees extended me an offer to join them.
