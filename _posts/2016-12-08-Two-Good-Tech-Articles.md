I read two good tech articles today.  One was written on LinkedIn called 'I'm A Data Guy And I Don't Get Why Everyone's Obsessed With Data' by
Alex Kirk.  [Link to Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/im-data-guy-i-dont-get-why-everyones-obsessed-alex-kirk?trk=eml-email_feed_ecosystem_digest_01-hero-0-null&midToken=AQFVbWn_YBH0mw&fromEmail=fromEmail&ut=0lMCWRCCLyIDw1)

The author begins by explaining how the world is awash with information.  He mentions that for every "Data Is The Future" post he sees,
there is an equal and opposite reaction of "Ideas Are The Only Thing That Matters".

I agree with him in that, like most things in life, balance is key.  If your company is betting big on data alone, you'll be reduced
to only seeing everything as a nail to hit with your data-shaped hammer.  If you pull a pre-world War American isolationist viewpoint
towards ideas, your competitors will save more time and energy on decision-making using data well, allowing them more time to also create
ideas with which to beat you over the head with later on.

The second was called 'How to Quickly and Easily Get Started with Hyperconvergence' by Brian Peterson, Bob Perkins, and Jakub Rzeszutko.

The big idea here is centered around the term coined 'hyperconvergence'.  Some of the network and server terminology is over my head at this
point in my career, but the main points they address are:
**1.** Hyperconvergence gives you the speed you need to stay ahead of the curve.
**2.** It consolidates storage into servers with internal spinning and solid state drives that are cheaper and easier to automate than traditional storage
**3.** Itâ€™s also insanely easy to install.
