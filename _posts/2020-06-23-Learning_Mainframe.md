So I was tasked to learn some basic mainframe knowledge for a client project.  I didn't know where to start, so did a Google search and checked Reddit (my default choice) for recommendations of resources. I quickly came upon IBM's Master the Mainframe content.  It is a free course that gets you up to speed with modern Z series mainframes.

I will post a few articles in the coming days as I go through the challenges.
