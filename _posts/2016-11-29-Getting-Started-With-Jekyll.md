  I've been wanting to create a website for some time now.  I love to procrastinate.  I thought about Wordpress, but saw an article on how to incorporate Jekyll with Github pages to create a static site to showcase work and for blogging.  I knew immediately that I'd love this.  Easy to set up, a full commit history on Github, and without the cost and security issues of hosting.

  I hope to use this blog as a place to showcase some of my projects and to discuss a wide range of topics.  In no particular order, I would like to share some of my favorite blogs, food recipes, technology, personal finance, do-it-yourself, well-being, and more.

  Stay Tuned!
