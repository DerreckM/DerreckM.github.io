A few days ago I received a formal offer to come work for Forsythe Technology in Skokie beginning January 2017.
Forsythe has a lot of Fortune 1000 clients and has relationships with many reputable vendors.  It seems like a great
opportunity to work for a good sized IT company and learn about many aspects of their business.  What I really like about
their program is that there will be three 2-month rotations where you get to experience different aspects of their IT business
and get a feel for what areas you have the most passion for and work with your strengths.  I'll have plenty of time to figure out
the exact role for me, but am very thankful for the opportunity to get some hands on experience with cutting-edge technologies,
as well as classroom training, and support towards obtaining crucial IT certifications.  Forsythe has a lot of Fortune 1000 clients
 and has relationships with many reputable vendors.
